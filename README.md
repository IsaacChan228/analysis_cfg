# Multi-Tool Control Flow Graph Comparison Framework

## Overview
This framework provides automated comparison and analysis of control flow graphs (CFGs) generated by multiple binary analysis tools. It standardizes basic block identifiers across different tools, performs comprehensive statistical analysis, and generates visualizations to compare the effectiveness and characteristics of each analysis tool.

## Supported Analysis Tools
The framework supports comparison of five major binary analysis tools:

### Required Tools
- **Radare2** - Open-source static analysis framework
- **Ghidra** - NSA's open-source software reverse engineering framework
- **Angr Fast** - Angr symbolic execution engine (fast analysis mode)

### Optional Tools (graceful degradation if unavailable)
- **Angr Emul** - Angr symbolic execution engine (emulation mode)
- **GCC** - GNU Compiler Collection CFG generation

The framework requires at least 2 tools to be successful for meaningful comparison. Optional tools may fail without terminating the analysis.

### Input Format Support
- **DOT format** (.dot) - Standard graph description language used by Radare2 and Angr
- **Ghidra GF format** (.gf) - Ghidra's native graph format
- Automatic format detection and parsing based on file extension and content structure


## Analysis Methodology

### Basic Block Name Standardization
The framework implements comprehensive basic block identifier normalization to enable meaningful comparison across tools:
- Removes tool-specific prefixes (`dbg.`, `sym.`, `imp.`, `fcn.`, `reloc.`, `unk.`)
- Normalizes address formats to lowercase hexadecimal
- Handles compiler-generated suffixes (`.part.N`, `.isra.N`, `.cold.N`)
- Preserves switch cases and labeled blocks that are important in CFG analysis
- Filters out invalid identifiers while preserving address-based blocks

### Graph Analysis and Metrics
The framework performs comprehensive graph-theoretic analysis using NetworkX:
- **Node Analysis**: Basic block count, unique block identification
- **Edge Analysis**: Control flow edge mapping and validation
- **Graph Density**: Measures connectivity (edges / possible_edges)
- **Degree Analysis**: In-degree and out-degree statistics for control flow
- **Connected Components**: Strongly connected component identification
- **Structural Similarity**: Multi-dimensional comparison of graph topology including:
  - Node and edge count similarity
  - Graph density patterns
  - Degree distribution analysis
  - Strongly connected component structure

### Entry Point Detection (Main Function)
For each tool, the framework automatically detects the main function entry point as the pivot for all structural comparisons:
- **GCC**: Prefers a node labeled `ENTRY` (e.g., `fn_xxx_basic_block_xxx`), or the first basic block in the `cluster_main` subgraph.
- **Ghidra**: Prefers a node with `Symbols="main"`, or the first node in the graph.
- **Angr / Radare2**: Prefers a node whose label contains `main` (case-insensitive), or the first node with an address like `0x4xxxxx`, or the first node in the graph.
- If no entry point is found, the tool's similarity results will be marked as `N/A`.

### Structural Similarity Methodology
- **Entry-point pivoted**: All pairwise comparisons are strictly based on the structure reachable from the detected entry point (main function) in each tool's CFG.
- **No name-based or Jaccard block/edge comparison**: All name-based logic and outputs have been removed. Only structure/topology is compared.
- **Multi-metric, weighted scoring**: Combines node/edge count, entry neighborhood, path structure, branch patterns, and density, with highest weights on entry neighborhood and path structure.
- **N/A handling**: If either tool lacks a valid entry point, the similarity is reported as `N/A` in all outputs (CSV, report, heatmap).

## Technical Implementation

### Core Libraries and Dependencies
- **NetworkX**: Graph creation, analysis, and algorithms
- **Matplotlib**: Visualization generation (charts, heatmaps)
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and CSV export
- **Python Standard Library**: Regular expressions, file I/O

### Key Components
1. **CFGNormalizer**: Handles format parsing and basic block identifier standardization
2. **MultiCFGComparator**: Main analysis engine and comparison logic
3. **Logger**: Dual output system (console + file logging)

### Error Handling and Robustness
- **Graceful Degradation**: Continues analysis if one tool fails (except critical tools)
- **File Validation**: Checks for file existence, readability, and content validity
- **Format Detection**: Automatic handling of different graph formats
- **Memory Management**: Efficient handling of large basic block sets
